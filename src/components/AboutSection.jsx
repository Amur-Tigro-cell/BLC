      <h2>Build fluency, confidence, and community</h2>
      <p>
        The BAIUST Language Club (BLC) is the university hub for confident communication. We combine
        practice-heavy sessions with structured feedback so members progress from first draft to polished delivery.

        Whether you are prepping for an interview, presenting research, or hosting a cultural event, BLC gives
        you the space, coaching, and peers to grow.
